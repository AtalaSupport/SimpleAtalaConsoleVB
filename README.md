# SimpleAtalaConsoleVB

[Official Home Page for all versions of SimpleAtalaConsole](https://github.com/AtalaSupport/SimpleAtalaConsole/wiki)

This is a 64 bit .NET Framework 4.6.2 console app with minimal Atalasoft references set written in VB.NET 

It is meant to be used as a quick starting point for Repros that do not require UI (winforms/wpf) and are not web applications.  

We have a minimal [WebDocumentViewer with WebDocumentThumbnailer](https://github.com/AtalaSupport/SimpleWDVwithWDT) sample app as well as minimal WebCapture (WingScan) apps for web and our AdvanceScanToFile is an excellent minimal Winforms app. For Wpf, we have WpfAnnotations.  

This is the VB.NET version. For other languages / targets, please see [SimpleAtalaConsole](https://github.com/AtalaSupport/SimpleAtalaConsole/wiki) for more options

## Licening
This applicaiton requires at minimum any level of DotImage licensing or a valid DotImage eval license on the machine where you are building and running.  

## SDK Dependencies
This app was built based on 2026.2. It targets .NET Framework 4.6.2 and was created in Visual Studio 2022. However, it's fairly forward and backward compatible as distributed. If you start adding references, you can run into issues if you're using an especially outdated version of DotImage. It should also open and run equally well in Visual Studio 2026 without undue modification.  

Regardless, it assumes you ahve installed a valid copy of Atalasoft DotImage in the default location. If you have multiple versions installed, you may want to go to the Project Properties and visit the References tab to adjust the references folder. Defaults point to:  

`C:\Program Files (x86)\Atalasoft\DotImage 2026.2\bin\4.6.2\x64`

## Cloning this repository
To use this repro just use:  

```
git clone https://github.com/AtalaSupport/SimpleAtalaConsoleVB.git SimpleAtalaConsoleVB
```

If you've got DotImage 2026 installed and licensed, it should just build and run.
